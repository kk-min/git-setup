Scripts for setting up git repos on a new machine.

## Requirements
- [Requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) library: `pip install requests`

## Usage

1. Add your github [access token](https://docs.github.com/en/enterprise-server@3.4/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token) in config.toml. Ensure that this token has permission to read repositories. If setting up a fine-grained token, ensure that it has read access to repository metadata at minimum to read private repos.
2. `python clone_repos.py <path>` to clone all repositories under `<path>`.
